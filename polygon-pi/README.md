## Pi Estimate Using Polygons
This is another graphical estimate of the Greek Pi that uses polygons. The basic concept is to create a polygon with as many sides as possible and take the ratio of its perimeter over the radius of the initial circle squared. This usually results in values that are way more accurate than the Monte Carlo approach.

Parameters:

`angle` - Angle between 2 sides of the polygon

`radius` - Radius of the initial circle
